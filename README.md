# IssueTracker

## Description
- This website is an IssueTracker application in ASP.NET that tracks issues in projects as tickets, allowing users to customize tickets, projects, comments, roles, and profiles. 
- The login page uses SendGrid authentication with a SQLite server storing their name, email address, and contact details in a users-relational table.
- The dashboard page displays data regarding these tickets, projects, and roles through incorporating information from the SQLite database.
- The website offers different status to users like Admins or developers to be able to manage roles and projects in different degrees.
- The backend is implemented by C# with access to the frontend stack of HMTL/CSS.
